# PooLang

A Tiny Interpreted but a Fast language written in Rust, featuring variable declarations, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and control flow. This project includes a lexer, parser, and interpreter. The name `Poo` originates from Guinea Pig translated from `Burmese`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with correct operator precedence.
- **Variable Declarations**: Uses `poo` keyword for variable declarations.
- **Mutable Variables**: Like in Rust, all variables are immutable by default. Uses `mut` instead of `poo` for mutable variables.
- **Conditional Statements**: Includes `if`, and `else` for branching.
- **Control Flow**: Supports `while` and `for in` loops and `return` statements.
- **Custom Operators**:
  - Short hand syntax for assignment: `<:`
  - Assignment and Reassignment operator: `=`
  - Arrow operator: `>>`
- **Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter**: A full pipeline from tokenizing source code to executing it.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Curl the latest release.

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/shayyz-code/poo/releases/download/v0.1/poo > poo
```

2. Consider the installation directory.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads && mkdir ~/poo && mv ./poo ~/poo
```

3. Add it to your Environment Variables.

```bash
export PATH=~/poo:$PATH
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To run the interpreter on a source file:

```bash
poo <path_to_your_source_file>
```

Example:

```bash
poo app.poo
```

## üìù Syntax Overview

The language features basic syntax for arithmetic, variable declarations, and control flow:

### **Variable Declarations**

Both in short hand and regular assignment operator.

```poo
poo x <: 10;
mut y int = 5 + 2 * 3;
```

### **Arithmetic Operations**

```poo
poo result int = x + y * 2 - 10 / 2;
```

### **Conditional Statements**

```poo
if x > y {
    return x;
} else {
    return y;
}
```

### **Loops**

```poo
use std::pout;

mut count <: 0;

while count < 10 {
    count = count + 1;
}

for i in 0..4 step 2 {
    pout("Hello, World ", i);
}
```

### **Functions**

```poo
use std::pout;

poof getName () >> string {
    poo name <: "Shayy";
    return name;
}

pout(getName());
```

## üìö Example Code

Example codes are provided in this repo.
Try a rotating donut in my PooLang :D

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shayyz-code/poo

```

```bash
cd ./poo

```

```bash
./poo examples/donut.poo

```

## Test the speed

```bash
poo examples/app.poo --speed
```
